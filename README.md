# Tic Tac Toe

In this project I will be making a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in a browser, using what I've learned about Factory Functiions and The Module Pattern in JavaScript.

[This project is part of The Odin Project's JavaScript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe)

I have not yet added the possibility of playing against the computer. I might come back and do this later.
